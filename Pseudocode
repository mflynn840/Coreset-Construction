Initialize the coreset as an empty set.

Compute the initial weights for all data points.

For each point in the coreset:

  a. Compute the sub-sampling probabilities for the data points.

  b. Select the top m data points with the highest probability values.

  c. Compute the weighted mean and covariance of the selected data points.

  d. Compute the projection matrix from the covariance matrix.

  e. Project the selected data points onto the subspace.

  f. Compute the weights of the projected data points.

  g. Add the weighted mean of the projected data points to the coreset.

  h. Update the weights for the remaining data points based on the projected data points.

Return the coreset.



Sure! Here's a better formatted list of the steps to construct a composable core set:

  1) Initialize an empty set of points, called the "core set".
  2)Read in the first data point from the stream.
  3)Add the first data point to the core set.
  4)Read in the next data point from the stream.
  5)Compute the distance between the new data point and each point in the current core set.
  6)If the new data point is closer to any point in the current core set than a certain threshold distance, skip the new data point and go back to step 4.
  7)If the new data point is not closer to any point in the current core set than the threshold distance, add the new data point to the core set.

Repeat steps 4-7 for each new data point in the stream.
