Initialize the coreset as an empty set.

Compute the initial weights for all data points.

For each point in the coreset:

  a. Compute the sub-sampling probabilities for the data points.

  b. Select the top m data points with the highest probability values.

  c. Compute the weighted mean and covariance of the selected data points.

  d. Compute the projection matrix from the covariance matrix.

  e. Project the selected data points onto the subspace.

  f. Compute the weights of the projected data points.

  g. Add the weighted mean of the projected data points to the coreset.

  h. Update the weights for the remaining data points based on the projected data points.

Return the coreset.
